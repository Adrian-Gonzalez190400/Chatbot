## Description
Chatbot ITSUR is an academic project where a chatbot is designed to help students to get information about the institution. This information is mainly public information that can be found in [ITSUR's website](http://www.itsur.edu.mx/home.php) or calling by phone to the institution, but that sometimes is dificult to find for new students.

## Use cases
__Start conversation with the chatbot__

The student wants to know information about the computer systems teachers or about the location of the main offices in the institution. The student accesses the chatbot web application and indicates that he/she wants to start a conversation. The chatbot sends a greeting message to the student and shows up a list of different options that the user can consult. The student sends a message with the option that he/she wants to consult. The chatbot searches and displays the requested information and if it doesn't have information about it, it lets them know.

__End conversation with the chatbot (Optional)__

The student got all needed information through one or several queries to the chatbot. The student thanks the chatbot through a message. The chatbot reply with a message asking if there is anything else it can help with. The student indicates that he/she doesnÂ´t need more information. The chatbot says goodbye and thanks for consulting it.
